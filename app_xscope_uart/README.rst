XScope UART data transport Example 
==================================

:scope: Example
:description: Demonstrates redirecting XScope output via a UART transport rather than an xCONNECT link
:keywords: xscope
:boards: XK-1A

Provides a simple example of redirecting XScope output via a UART rather than via the xCONNECT link used as default.
This is useful for legacy boards containing G series devices and also for boards without the xCONNECT link connected to the XSYS header.
